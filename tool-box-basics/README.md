# Common Toolbox methods

In functional programming we pefer to use many small declartive fucntions that are immutable and easy to reason about. In this section we will explore how to do this in four languages and then review how each of these languages provides this fucntion or somthing close to it.

## Mapping and Filtering
I think the first higher order fucntion that every impressed me was either linqs implamentation of Where or Select, which functional programmers normally refer to as filter and map respectively. These two fucntions are so powerful that some programmers have designed entire actectures centered on them (Pipes and Filters). Take a look at example one and two in each of the languages.
